## 2026-07-12 - O(N) penalty with Array.shift() in queues
**Learning:** In Kahn's topological sort and similar algorithms, using `queue.shift()` inside a while loop causes an O(K) penalty per iteration since the entire remaining array needs to be shifted in memory, turning an O(V+E) algorithm effectively into O(V^2+E) worst case.
**Action:** Always replace `queue.shift()` with a tracking pointer (e.g., `let queueIndex = 0; queue[queueIndex++]`) when using JavaScript arrays as queues in performance-critical graph algorithms.
## 2026-07-12 - Optimize renderTaskRow DOM allocations
**Learning:** Caching unattached template nodes and instantiating them via `.cloneNode(false)` reduces DOM instantiation overhead in O(N) render loops significantly.
**Action:** Apply this optimization to other hot-path rendering elements such as rows, cells, and stack containers.
## 2026-07-12 - Prevent Maximum Call Stack with replaceChildren
**Learning:** Passing a large array of elements directly to `replaceChildren(...rows)` using the spread operator can exceed the maximum call stack size and causes a significant memory allocation and garbage collection spike during layout trashing, particularly in functions that render large tables or gantt charts.
**Action:** Always append large collections of DOM elements to a `DocumentFragment` first, then pass the single fragment to `replaceChildren()`.
