## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Imported the upstream Strix quick-scan workflow, helper scripts, and
  source-regression tests for this repository.
- Added companion dependency-review and OSV workflows so Strix
  manifest-only findings can be verified against authoritative PR-head
  checks.
- Added operator documentation for Strix workflow behavior and reusable
  warning/deprecation root-cause triage guidance.
- Added `requirements-strix-ci.txt` so Strix CI dependencies are pinned
  and reviewable by companion SCA workflows.

### Changed

- Adapted Strix scanning to the static ScopeWeave repository root and
  documented Kubernetes/IaC as follow-up work rather than a current
  blocker.
- Kept workflow and `scripts/ci/` changes in Strix PR scope so security
  automation changes are not silently skipped.
